# This module provides services for creating, populating, and using a symbol
# table. Recall that each symbol has a scope from which it is visible
# in the source code. In the symbol table, each symbol is given a running
# number (index) within the scope, where the index starts at 0 and is
# reset when starting a new scope.

# TODO :you will probably need to use two separate hash tables to implement the symbol
# table: one for the class-scope and another one for the subroutine-scope. When a new subroutine
# is started, the subroutine-scope table should be cleared.
